This request was not made for a commercial purpose. Specifically, I am writing on behalf of the
Invisible Institute, an award-winning nonprofit journalistic production company based in
Chicago’s Woodlawn neighborhood. The Invisible Institute’s mission is to enhance the capacity
of citizens to hold public institutions accountable, and to disseminate information to members of
the general public concerning their safety, welfare, and legal rights. I am requesting these
documents in order to fulfill that mission. As such, I request a fee waiver for this data. Because
this goal concerns information regarding the safety, welfare, and legal rights of the public, a fee
waiver is in the public interest. To the extent that you intend to assess any charges, please notify
me to discuss first.
Thank you for your time and prompt attention to this matter. Please contact me should you have
any questions related to this request.

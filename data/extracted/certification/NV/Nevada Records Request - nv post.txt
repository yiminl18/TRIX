Hello Ms. Floyd
This is an email for Mr. Sherlock, whom I just spoke with on the phone. To clarify regarding this request
 We are only
seeking the information requested that can be provided in a digital spreadsheet format, and that we understand

Please contact me with any further questions.
Thank you
